title: Finding a window manager for optimal trackpoint usage
---

There seems to be a cock waving excercise amongst the Linux "elite" over who can design a work-flow with the least mouse usage. This is silly, as the mouse is preferable in certain situations (assuming you don't have a handicap), and this is an objective fact. In this post, I will explain how I can make such a bold claim.  

Anyone who says that they can't think of even one use case for preferring the mouse over a keyboard is being academically dishonest.
