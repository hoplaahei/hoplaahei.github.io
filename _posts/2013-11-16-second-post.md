## Oven Omlette Recipe

Oven Omlette is convenient for geeks like me -- who are too glued to their computer to spend time cooking -- because it is:

- quick to make
- made up of basic household ingredients
- nutritious

Here are the steps to make it for two people:

1.  Crack 6 eggs into a bowl
2.  Pour in 118ml (4oz) milk 
3.  Whisk together
4.  Grate in some cheese
5.  Chop in some veg (I use onions)
6.  Put some cut up bacon in 
7.  Pour into round casserole dish (pans are a bitch to clean off)
8.  Put in oven on a gas mark between 5 and 6 (British Ovens)
9.  Wait 20/25 minutes

When I feel a little peckish I spend 10 minutes making this and then by the time I come back to it I'm starving enough to devour it. I give half to my girlfriend or put the rest in the fridge for later.
