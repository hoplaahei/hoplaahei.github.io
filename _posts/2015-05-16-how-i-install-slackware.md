title: How I install Slackware

# Preparation

Disclaimer: these commands will wipe your disk. The commands use the form `sdX`, where you need to replace the `sdX` with e.g., `sda`, and where 'a' is usually the first disk (but double check with `fdisk` or `gdisk` to make sure). Google if you don't understand how to use these tools. 

## Get Slackware ISO onto a USB pen

See the [torrents](http://www.slackware.com/getslack/torrents.php) page. I chose [Slackware 14.1 64-bit](http://www.slackware.com/torrents/slackware64-14.1-install-dvd.torrent) from the bottom of the page. At the time of writing it is the stable edition.

Even though the ISO is for DVDs, it works just as well on a USB stick (replace sdX with the USB stick device):

```
dd if=slackware-DVD-iso-you-downloaded.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=1M && sync
```

## SSD memory cell clearing

This step is not at all essential to installing Slackware, but it is something I always do out of habit. The tl;dr of SSD memory cell clearing is that it could reset any slow down in SSD write speeds by returning it to factory defaults:

```
echo -n "mem" > /sys/power/state # suspend to RAM to unfreeze security
hdparm --user-master u --security-set-pass PasSWorD /dev/sdX
hdparm --user-master u --security-erase PasSWorD /dev/sdX
```

The `ArchWiki` has a good [article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSD_memory_cell_clearing) on this, so I'm not going to reiterate the steps in detail.

## Partitioning

The SlackDocs wiki has an [install](http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:install) guide for standard installation. Some modern computers force the use of UEFI boot with a GPT partitioning scheme, and if you require/want this then see the UEFI [README](http://slackware.mirrorcatalogs.com/slackware64-14.1/README_UEFI.TXT).

Afer partitioning, simply run:

```
setup
```

If following the steps in my guide, then you are using a USB installation, so when prompted for the installation media choose USB, and the installer will detect the install packages correctly. EFI and swap partitions should get detected and formatted automatically. Follow the `SlackDocs` on [installation](http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:install) for further advice, but the installer is usually clever enough in figuring out what you want.

If following the partitioning scheme in this guide, then skip to the next section. If, however, you followed the links in SlackDocs for `LVM` (Logical Volume Manager) installation, then follow these additional steps before rebooting after the install:

```
mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
mount -o bind /proc /mnt/proc
mount -o bind /sys /mnt/sys
chroot /mnt
$( /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -r )
exit
```

And modify `/boot/efi/EFI/Slackware/elilo.conf` for `UEFI` systems, or `/etc/lilo.conf` for `BIOS` systems to use the LVM volumes. Change the append line to:

```
append="root=/dev/yourVG/yourLV vga=normal ro"
```

Replace 'yourVG' with whatever you named the `Volume Group` and 'yourLV' with the `Logical Volume` you created.  

Now run:

```
eliloconfig # or liloconfig if you use lilo
```

And reboot.

## Get correct keys on the keyboard

After logging in it is useful to start `X` with `startx` command to run the default window manager selected in installation e.g., `windowmaker`, but the keys might not be right on the keyboard. For a quick fix, run from the terminal e.g.,

```
setxkbmap gb # for a British keyboard
```

This will only work for the current session, but we will set it permanently later. 

## Wireless networking

Enable `NetworkManager` at boot:

```
chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager
```

Start NetworkManager:

```
/etc/rc.d/rc.networkmanager start
```

From the terminal list the available access points:

```
nmcli dev wifi
```

Connect to one (start this line with a space to prevent the wifi password getting stored in the history file of the shell)

```
 nmcli dev wifi connect YourAccessPoint password YoUrPaSs
```

## Follow the beginners guide

Do all the steps in the [begginers guide](http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:beginners_guide) and also follow the link to [localisation](http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:localization), as you can do useful things like get the 'Â£' sign working permanently on a UK keyboard in `X`. 

The only thing I want to add to the steps in these guides is to follow the advice in the comments of `/etc/profile.d/lang.sh` and not enable UTF-8 for the locale. I experienced strange behaviour with some applications, e.g., `xpdf` failing to load some PDFs. If, however, UTF-8 is essential to your system then you can still get the problem apps to load by launching them with `C` locale like this:

```
LANG=C xpdf
```

## Learn to use Slackbuilds

[Install](http://www.sbopkg.org/downloads.php) `sbopkg` and sync with the remote repository by running:

```
sbopkg -r
```

## Bastardize your installation with multilib

Adding 32-bit support to any Linux system currently draws in an extra layer of complexity that we could all do without, but it's a necessary evil to get some applications running. For instance, many wine apps need 32-bit support, and I prefer the near native speed for games it gives me (no my laptop does not support [VGA passthrough](https://wiki.debian.org/VGAPassthrough) with KVM).

Fortunately, [slackpkg+](http://slakfinder.org/slackpkg+.html) makes converting Slackware to multilib easy:

```
installpkg slackpkg+-[downloaded-version]-noarch-2mt.txz
/usr/doc/slackpkg+-*/setupmultilib.sh
```

From the slackpkg+ documentation:

> Periodically you should run "slackpkg install multilib"
> after run "slackpkg upgrade-all"

## Support for nVidia Optimus

Someone made a one-liner to install it. See the [docs](http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:hardware:nvidia_optimus}.
