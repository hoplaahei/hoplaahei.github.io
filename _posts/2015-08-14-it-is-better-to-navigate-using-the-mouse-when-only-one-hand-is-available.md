title: It is better to navigate using the mouse when only one hand is available
---

Window manager keyboard shortcuts inherantly require a modifier key (e.g., holding onto 'Alt' key or 'Windows' key, and will do so until the day when someone designs advanced AI that can contextually detect when someone is typing rather than performing a management action on the window frame itself. That said, there are plenty of keyboard shortcuts that are cumbersome to perform with just one hand. Can you see where my argument is going yet? Hint: "it is better to navigate using the mouse when only one hand is available".

There are plenty of times when two hands do not rest on the keyboard. Examples of such situations:

- holding a drink
- passing documents
- leaning your elbow on the couch (if on a laptop)
- picking your nose
- jerking off
- stroking your neck beard
- 
Anyone who says they never do any of the above is lying; nobody is stooped over a computer desk with both hands on the keyboard 100% of the time. Try doing any of the above tasks whilst also copying some text from your web browser to a terminal using just the keyboard. Even assuming you have a keyboard-optimised browsing extension enabled, you still need to either move the caret to select text, or search for the start point of the text, create a mark, and search for the end point. This will also require switching modes if using vim-like keybindings, or using finger gymnastics if using emacs-like keybindings (remember you only have one hand available). Either way, this generates a lot of mental activity that frustrates ones train of thought, whereas just selecting the text with a mouse is an almost subconscious action, and one that only requires to pin-point a spacial target.

All window managers should at least optionally support:

 - click-to-raise (and/or clicking on titlebar and/or window borders to raise)
 - click to close, move, and resize
 
Unfortunately, however, there seems to be a cock waving excercise amongst the Linux "elite" over who can design a window manager that supports the least mouse usage possible. This is sad, considering that there is little cost or difficulty for WM developers to do the kind thing by adding a couple of lines of xlib or xcb calls to enable some basic mouse functionality for those who don't take such a hard line on mouse usage. Please stop designing arcane window management just for the sake of geek-cred.

I wouldn't even be that arsed to make a whole post about this, but I've noticed one to many websites and forum posts from developers listing "no mouse" as a feature of the WM. Being forced to hold onto MOD key + trackpoint just to raise a window when I'm using one hand makes your window manager automatically crap. Fair enough, you gave up your time to make it for free, and no one forced me to waste 10 minutes of my life installing and quickly deleting it, but  stop spamming forums and encouraging your band of fellow cock-wavers with propoganda about the evils of mouse usage; it is academically dishonest. You fucking know you want to reach for that mouse. You miss it, especially when jerking it to porn. Stop lying to yourself.
