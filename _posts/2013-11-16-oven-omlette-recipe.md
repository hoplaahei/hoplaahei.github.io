Too glued to your computer to waste time cooking? Give Oven Omlette a try. It is:

- quick to make
- made up of basic household ingredients
- nutritious

Here are the steps to make it for two people:

1.  Crack 6 eggs into a bowl
2.  Pour in 118ml (4oz) milk 
3.  Whisk together
4.  Grate in some cheese
5.  Chop in some veg (I use onions)
6.  Put some cut up bacon in 
7.  Pour into round casserole dish (pans are a bitch to clean off)
8.  Put in oven on a gas mark between 5 and 6 (British Ovens)
9.  Wait 20/25 minutes

If you throw the gas up to 6 it will probaby do in 15 minutes, but I leave it in for 25 minutes on gas 5/6 so it cooks well. I give half to my girlfriend or put the rest in the fridge for later.
